    <p class="animal">
        The Calandra Lark is a large, heavily built lark with a relatively short tail. His head is equipped
         a large beak with a distinctly curved culmen. The eye is broadly ringed in white, with a dark loral line at
         the front and a clear "eyebrow" on the back. The throat is white and the base of the neck wears a black half-collar
         obvious topped with white. The ocher chest is slightly spotted. The belly is off-white. The flanks of
         birds from the south of the range are warmer. The upperparts are medium brown with a brown bar
         dark on the median coverts.
         Seen from below in flight, it shows a very dark underwing with a white posterior edge. You can see
         also the lateral edges of the tail white but less obviously.
         The legs are pink, with a hind nail the size of the finger.
         Both sexes are practically similar. Simply, the black spot on the neck is smaller in the female.
         The juvenile is distinguished by a very reduced or even absent black collar and upper coverts bordered
         with a pale hem. <br>

        Size : 20 cm <br>
        Wingspan : 38 to 40 cm <br>

        Longevity : 5 years <br>

        Order: Passeriformes <br>
         Family: Alaudidae <br>

        <br>
        Calandra Lark's contact call is dry, rolled and nasal: “tchrryup, klitrr”.
         Its song is reminiscent of that of the skylark but slower. It emits chirping and high-pitched sounds at a
         fast pace. It alternates flute notes and others with a hoarse tone. In the spring, the males are very
         noisy and sing loudly. She is an excellent imitator of the song of other birds.
         Like all larks, it sings mainly in flight but it also sings on the ground, which allows
         see his swollen black and white throat that serves as a flag.
         The Calandre is said to be gray, jiggle or piggy bank.
